## Global:
1. Measures of Central Tendencies:
    - Mean
    - Median
    - ~~Mode~~ -> In a topological sense, the mode would always be distorted
2. Measures of Dispersion:
    - Standard deviation
    - Variance 
    - ~~Range~~ -> too absolute in a topological context
    - Interquartile Range
3. General Tests:
    - T-test
    - ANOVA test on different TDA algorithms?
    - F-test -> compare popululation variance instead of mean like a t-test would
    
4. Convulutions?
